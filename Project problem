# Web-Scrapper-SeaBreeze
SeaBreeze Web scrapper
The problem
- webiste like seabreeze and surfline are great but they fail to send you any sort of notification and or commincation on when the swell is going to be good unless you have iphone
- ideally you would have a program that would read the wind and swell conditions that would then email me or add a time slot to time tree or something like that 
- Need to find a source of data preferable wave height and wind conditions are the most important
- good source of data for wind direction https://beta.bom.gov.au/location/australia/western-australia/lower-west/318617-pioneer-gardens/accessible-forecast
- need consider the IOT that is available to me and whether there is a capstone project in tafe that could tap this into
